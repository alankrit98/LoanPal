These automated systems analyze multiple data points including but not limited to your credit history, income, employment status, transaction patterns, and other financial indicators.

                      The AI-based assessment provides recommendations and preliminary evaluations to assist lending partners in their decision-making process.

                      Using our Platform and completing a loan application does not guarantee approval. Credit decisions are based on multiple factors including lender-specific policies, risk appetite, regulatory requirements, and your individual financial profile. We do not influence, control, or override lending decisions made by our partner institutions.
