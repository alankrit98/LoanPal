      },
      {
        question: "Is there a fee to apply for a loan?",
        answer: "No, applying for a loan on our platform is completely free. Processing fees are only applicable if your loan is approved and you choose to accept the offer. These fees are deducted from the disbursement amount."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I check my application status?",
        answer: "You can track your application status in real-time by logging into your account and visiting the 'Dashboard' or 'My Loans' section."

    eligibility: [
      {
        question: "What are the eligibility criteria?",
        answer: "To apply, you must be an Indian citizen, aged between 21 and 60 years, with a monthly income of at least ₹15,000. You must also have a valid PAN card and Aadhaar card."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need a high credit score?",
        answer: "While a credit score of 700+ is preferred, we also consider other factors like income stability and banking history. We have partners who cater to new-to-credit customers as well."
      },
      {
        question: "What documents are required?",
        answer: "You strictly need: 1) Identity Proof (PAN/Aadhaar), 2) Address Proof, 3) Bank Statements (last 3 months), and 4) A selfie for liveness check. All processes are digital."
      }
    ],
    repayment: [
      {
        question: "How do I repay my loan?",
        answer: "We recommend setting up e-NACH (auto-debit) for hassle-free repayments. You can also pay manually via UPI, Debit Card, or Net Banking through our app."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I prepay or foreclose my loan?",
        answer: "Yes, foreclosure is allowed. Depending on the lending partner, there might be a minimum lock-in period (usually 3-6 months) or a nominal foreclosure charge. Check your loan agreement for details."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I delay my EMI payment?",
        answer: "Delayed payments attract penal charges as per the policy of the lender. Additionally, it will negatively impact your credit score, reducing your chances of getting loans in the future."
      }

    security: [
      {
        question: "Is my personal data safe?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We use bank-grade 256-bit SSL encryption to protect your data. We are ISO 27001 certified and strictly adhere to RBI's data localization and privacy guidelines."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you share my data with third parties?",
        answer: "We only share your data with registered lending partners, credit bureaus, and verification agencies necessary to process your loan. We never sell your data to third-party marketers."
